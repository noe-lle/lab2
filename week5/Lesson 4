JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.

Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.
JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard.
This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51, the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63:

WARNING !!
JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.
