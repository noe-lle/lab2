An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.
// const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];  

Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

const cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];

The following example also creates an Array, and assigns values to it:
const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
