Strings
Strings in PHP are surrounded by either double quotation marks, or single quotation marks.

Example
Double quoted string literals perform operations for special characters:

$x = "John";
echo "Hello $x";

Single quoted strings does not perform such actions, it returns the string like it was written, with the variable name:

Example
Single quoted string literals returns the string as it is:

$x = "John";
echo 'Hello $x';

String Length
The PHP strlen() function returns the length of a string.

Example
Return the length of the string "Hello world!":

echo strlen("Hello world!");
