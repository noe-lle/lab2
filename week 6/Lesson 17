In real life, a car is an object.
A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:

let car = "Fiat";
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

In the example above, this refers to the person object:
this.firstName means the firstName property of person.
this.lastName means the lastName property of person.
