JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.
This makes it easier to maintain a code-base.
Modules are imported from external files with the import statement.
Modules also rely on type="module" in the <script> tag.


<script type="module">
import message from "./message.js";
</script>

Export
Modules with functions or variables can be stored in any external file.
There are two types of exports: Named Exports and Default Exports.

Named Exports
export const name = "Jesse";
export const age = 40;

Default Exports
const message = () => {
const name = "Jesse";
const age = 40;
return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';
};

export default message;
